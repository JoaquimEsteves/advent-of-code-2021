# Advent of Code 2021

## Rules

* No cheating
    - IE: if I can't fix a day, I'll mark the file as `CHEATING.language`
* KISS
    - If a for loops is enough then leave it alone. Readability trumps all
* Breath is better than Depth
    - Prefer multiple languages and solutions to a proper fully optimized thing
* No Shit Input
    - Unless specifically mentioned by the problem, I'll assume that the input is correct.
      Example, if we're looking for the most common X, then I assume that I won't land
      on a case in which X and Y have the same number of ocurences
